Glacier Lake is an Online Tour Guidance system designed as a part of University coursework.

The entire project's design, documentation and coding was done by me individually. I used html,css and javascript to design the front-end 
while PHP and MySQL was used to handle the backend. No template or framework was used.

Allows users to book a tour to various destinations of their choosing with different price plan options. Users can pay for their booked 
tour or cancel it alltogether. Admin can monitor and manage all actions. CRUD functionality with rating, comments and gallery.
